🏨 Hotel Reservation Manager Using Red-Black Tree Data Structure

This project implements a Hotel Reservation Management System using the Red-Black Tree data structure to efficiently manage room reservations. The system allows users to check room availability, make, modify, and cancel reservations, ensuring optimal performance and minimal conflict with dates or resources.
Key Features:

⚡ Efficient Reservation Management: Using a Red-Black Tree ensures that the reservation data remains balanced, allowing fast insertion, removal, and lookup operations.
🕒 Real-Time Availability Checking: The system quickly checks room availability based on the dates of entry and exit, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
📜 History Tracking: All reservation actions, including cancellations, are tracked, providing full transparency and allowing for easy audits.
🚀 Optimized Performance: The Red-Black Tree structure provides a logarithmic time complexity for critical operations, making the system scalable and responsive, even with a large number of reservations.

This system offers a reliable and efficient solution for hotel room management, ensuring both users and hotel managers can easily interact with the system while benefiting from the performance advantages of a self-balancing binary search tree.
